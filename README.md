# LNM-Callback-Url
Callback url sample for LNM implemented in android application.

The CallbackURL refers to a hosted script that will receive all transactions related to your application from the Mpesa servers. The script will then store records for successful transactions in a table which can provide you with search capabilities to find specific payments or more in-depth data about your product.

To host the script:
 1. Buy a hosting service/plan and domain..
 2. Create a subdomain(optional)
 3. Host the script in the subdomain or public directory
